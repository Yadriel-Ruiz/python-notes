# print("Hello World")
#  Python is a program installed into your computer
# use the terminal in order to run python
# when running python you run it using terminal
# find the location of the file you want to run
# use ls in order to list the files in the directory
# use cd in order to change directories
# use pwd in order to print the working directory
# use python name-of-file.py in order to run the file

# if you run input() in python it will wait for you to type something
# if you run print() in python it will print something
# if you run print(input()) in python it will print what you type
# you can use if statements in python
# using char in python will allow you to use a single character
# using int in python will allow you to use a number
# using str in python will allow you to use a string
# using float in python will allow you to use a decimal number
# using bool in python will allow you to use a boolean
# using input in python will allow you to use a string


# Examples of using input and print **********************************************
# name = input("What is your name? ")
#
# print("Hello " + name + "!")

# name = input("What is your name? ")
# first_number = input("Give me a number: ")
# second_number = input("Give me another number: ")
# sum = int(first_number) + int(second_number)

# when printing a string and a number you need to convert the number to a string
# you can convert a number to a string by using str(number)
# print("The sum of " + first_number + " and " + second_number + " is " + str(sum) + ".")
# *********************************************************************************

# numbers in python are called integers********************************************
# examples of integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

# decimals in python are called floats
# examples of floats are 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0

# negative numbers in python are called negative integers
# examples of negative integers are -1, -2, -3, -4, -5

# negative decimals in python are called negative floats
# examples of negative floats are -1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0

# using // in python will allow you to divide and round down
#  example: 5 // 2 = 2

# using % in python will allow you to divide and get the remainder
#  example: 5 % 2 = 1

# type gives you the type of the variable
#  example: type(5) = int
#  example: type(5.0) = float
#  example: type("5") = str

# using == in python will allow you to check if two things are equal
#  example: 5 == 5 = True
#  example: 5 == 6 = False
#  example: 5 == "5" = False

# a string is false if it is empty
#  example: "" = False
#  example: "hello" = True

# boolean operators in python are and, or, not
#  example: True and True = True
#  example: True and False = False
#  example: False and False = False
#  example: True or True = True
#  example: True or False = True
#  example: False or False = False
#  example: not True = False
#  example: not False = True

# using > in python will allow you to check if something is greater than
#  example: 5 > 2 = True
#  example: 2 > 5 = False
#  example: 5 > 5 = False

#  using >= in python will allow you to check if something is greater than or equal to
#  example: 5 >= 2 = True
#  example: 2 >= 5 = False
#  example: 5 >= 5 = True

# you use booleans in if statements
#  example: if True:
#               print("Hello World")

# you can use elif (else if) in python to check another condition if the first condition is false
#  example: if True:
#               print("Hello World")
#           elif False:
#               print("Goodbye World")
